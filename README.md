# <center> Web Development Projects

I just put here the web projects I made to learn web development. As soon as i make a new project, I upload it here both as and inspiration.

I hope everyone will like it.

## Features for the projects:
- ##### Todo-List:
    - Make or delete list elements
    - The title is not necessary
    - You can edit the description of the elements
    - You can switch to dark mode
    - The list uses local storage to save the data in the browser
- ##### Tic-tac-toe
  - Two player game mode
  - Each player can win by horizontal, vertical or cross line
  - When the game ends, the players are able to start a new game
- ##### Calculator
  - The buttons on the screen can be clicked
  - The calculator's display can be cleared
  - There is included keyboard input feature made with the XML file. It can be used if the user hosts the project (I used Live Server extension for this)
  - As well as the Todo-list, this includes dark mode too
- ##### Stopwatch
  - The user can choose between stopwatch and timer
  - ###### Stopwatch mode
    - The stopwatch can be started/paused
    - Reset option
    - The user can add lap time
    - When the stopwatch resets, the laps will be removed
  - ###### Timer mode
    - The user can set a timer
    - When the timer resets, it will be set to the timer the user set
    - The user can nullify the timer by click on the zero
  - Changing between stopwatch and timer resets each modes

I know that the projects are not looking really good, but I focused the JavaScript part mode to make the functions working as good as possible.
